Brillo OS - Successfully Flashing

I wrote an Instructions, i hope i doesnt forget any steps.....

 

    I compile it with Ubuntu 14.10 64 bit as VM on Windows 10
    first i establish a Build environment, like here : Establishing a Build Environment | Android Open Source Project
    Install Repo : Downloading the Source | Android Open Source Project --> at step "repo init" you take the brillo source : 

-->

    repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/brillo/manifest/  

 

    	4.repo sync  

	5. source build/envsetup.sh  

 	6.lunch  

 	7. Choose " edison-eng "

	8.make  

 

      - i get a few errors, first it doesnt find some files p.e. the wifi driver and bluetooth, i download them at git (after i google them ) after that it works without problems

 

 

       9. The ".img" files at the "out" folder i flashed them with Intel Phone Flash Tool in Windows, in Ubuntu it doesnt work for me.

 

Here is the Result: check in outtput folder



It would be of great help if you explain in brief how you managed to flash the *.img brillo images to Edison?

I tried using the steps for fastboot

flash_tools/brillo-flashall-edison.sh - device/intel/edison - Git at Google

ut bootloader was not built from Brillo sources-boot-edison.bin.

######

booting

    sudo apt-get update  

 

Install Java 7 sdk

    $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

      zip curl zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 \  
      lib32ncurses5-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32z-dev ccache \

USB Access to Android Devices -->> change <username> to your own

    "Get the source"

 

Make in Home Directory a Folder "bin" and included him in your path

    $ mkdir ~/bin  
    $ PATH=~/bin:$PATH  

 

        Get "Repo tool" and rights to yourself

    $ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo  
    $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo  


Build "Working Directory" and "go in"

    $ mkdir brillo  
      
    $ cd brillo  

 

"Initialize Repo"

    $ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/brillo/manifest  
    $ repo sync  


--> Drink Coffee --> you have a "few" minutes

 

    Building


"Initialize + lunch + make"

    $ source build/envsetup.sh  
    $ lunch edison-eng  

 

--> go to the Path ~/brillo/tools/bdk/brunch/

    $ ./brunch bsp install edison  

 

--> from Path ~/brillo -->

    $ make  

--> Coffee or go to bed ^^ (6hr later......)

in the ~/brillo/out/target/product/edison folder there are a now few .img and .bin files

 

    Flash

 

After compile, you could get some files(totally, 19 files). The followings are required files to flash.

    boot.img, cache.img, ramdisk.img, recovery.img, system.img, userdata.img, gpt.bin
    edison_dnx_fwr.bin, edison_dnx_osr.bin, edison_ifwi-dbg-00.bin ~ edison_ifwi-dbg-06.bin
    u-boot-edison.bin, u-boot-edison.img
    FlashEdison.json

To flash these, you have to move above all files in one folder. And open your Phone Flash Tool Lite in windows.

Then you can see success message.

--> done
